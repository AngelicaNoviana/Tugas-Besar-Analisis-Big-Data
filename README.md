# Tugas-Besar-Analisis-Big-Data
This project analyzes how time and humidity affect temperature changes at Institut Teknologi Sumatera. Data is collected using an Arduino Uno with temperature and humidity sensors. Following data collection, analysis employs multiple linear regression to explore relationships among time, humidity, and temperature variables.
